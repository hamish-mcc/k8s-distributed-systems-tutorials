# k8s-distributed-systems-tutorials
Labs from the book 'Designing Distributed Systems' (O'Reilly) by Brendan Burns.

The book is available for free [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/designing-distributed-systems/en-us/).

The tutorials are based on Azure AKS however, I ran a local K8s cluster using [k3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/) instead. This required some small deviations from the lab instructions and these are captured in my notes for each lab.
